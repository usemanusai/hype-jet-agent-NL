- Include key information or story elements
- Prepare for call-to-action or conclusion

**60+ Second Range (Extended Engagement):**
- Requires higher production value and engagement
- Must justify extended time investment
- Include multiple value points or story beats
- Maintain interest through varied pacing and content

### Duration-Based Content Strategies

**Micro-Content (5-15 seconds):**
- Single concept or tip
- Visual-heavy with minimal text
- Immediate value delivery
- Strong hook in first second

**Short-Form (15-60 seconds):**
