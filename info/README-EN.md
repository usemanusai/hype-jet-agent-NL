# Hype Jet 6.1 EN - English Cinematic Content Script Machine

An advanced English AI agent system that transforms ideas into emotionally explosive, high-tension content for English markets. Built on the BMAD agent framework, Hype Jet EN replicates and enhances the ChatGPT Hype Jet 6.1 experience with a structured, orchestrated approach for English cinematic content script creation with comprehensive duration management.

## Overview

Hype Jet 6.1 EN is designed to "stop scrolling, generate clicks and convert attention into revenue" through the power of English cinematic storytelling. The system combines English emotional psychology, English visual storytelling expertise and strategic English brand positioning to create compelling English content scripts that perform across any duration from 15 seconds to 10 hours.

## English Core Philosophy with Duration Intelligence

Every English script must contain **English emotional voltage** - the psychological energy that creates immediate engagement and lasting impact for English-speaking audiences. The system focuses on six primary English emotional drivers, optimized for any duration:

- **Betrayal** - English trust broken, expectations disappointed - impactful in any timeframe
- **Redemption** - English transformation from failure to success - scalable across durations
- **Survival** - English overcoming obstacles, fighting against odds - adaptable to content length
- **Obsession** - English intense desire, unstoppable English pursuit - sustainable across timeframes
- **Revelation** - English hidden truth revealed, moment of English clarity - effective in any duration
- **Heartbreak** - English loss, disappointment, English emotional pain - powerful regardless of length
- **Transformation** - English change, growth, becoming something new - developable across all durations
